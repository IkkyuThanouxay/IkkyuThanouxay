👋 Hi, I’m @IkkyuThanouxay
👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, data analysis, and enhancing my skills in Python, C++ and C. I enjoy challenging myself and diving into new problems and projects to continually grow my coding capabilities.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python, C++, and C in my college courses, with an emphasis on applications in data analysis and full-stack development. I'm also trying to broaden my knowledge in web technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small-scale open source projects, particularly those that allow me to utilize and grow my skills in Python, C++, and C. I am open to any opportunities that will allow me to learn more about full-stack development and data analysis.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at ikkyustudyonly@gmail.com.
